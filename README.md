## About Us

Open-source software, due to its positive externality, remains under-supplied and under-utilized. We intend to solve this problem using network effects. Essentially, companies can use polyglot.network to improve their FOSS dependencies by paying only a fraction of the cost of doing it in-house. We work on bugfixes / features which are a priority for you but the costs are distributed over many customers.

We are currently working with a closed set of customers but will be opening for public signups soon. Please mail me at _hi@nileshtrivedi.com_ for any queries.

If you are a developer interested in working on open-source software with us, you should [join our developer community](https://community.polyglot.network/).
