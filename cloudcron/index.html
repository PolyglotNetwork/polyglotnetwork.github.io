    <h1>CloudCron: Painless Cron Jobs in the Cloud</h1>

    <h3>TL;DR: We're launching <a href="https://cloudcron.polyglot.network/">CloudCron (Beta)</a> which allows you to run cron jobs in the cloud easily. Sign up with email, give us a Docker image name, command, arguments and a cron schedule and you're done. We'll run the command in our cloud infrastructure and send the output to you over either en email or a webhook endpoint. </h3>

    <p>
      At <a href="/about/" target="_blank">polyglot.network</a>, we love open-source software. We're an OSS-only software development agency and our entire business is improving open-source software by adding features and bugfixes that our customers demand. There are some really nifty open-source tools out there which our customers want to run on a periodic basis. Here are a few examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>curl</code>, when run periodically, can act as a health-check.</li>

      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#cli" target="_blank">LightHouse</a> by Google can generate a detailed performance report of any webpage. This is the same tool that Chrome's has built-in as "Performance" tab of its Dev Console. Usage: <code>lighthouse https://yoursite.example.com/</code></li>

      <li><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html" target="_blank">Apache Benchmark</a> can load-test your webapp by firing concurrent requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In many of these cases, users want to receive the output of these commands to their email address or to a webhook endpoint, where this could be consumed programmatically. However, setting these up as periodic tasks is too cumbersome for many.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You need to provision a server. Setting up a billing account with AWS or GCP and ensuring that costs are contained - is not trivial.</li>
      <li>Need to figure out a strategy for maintaining and rotating credentials</li>
      <li>Install all the dependencies (such as an OS, libraries) and keep them up-to-date</li>
      <li>Write custom code to send the output to an endpoint such as email or webhook</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All this is not hard for developers, but it IS cumbersome and annoying. It should be dead-easy to run batch jobs in the cloud. Since polyglot.network is all about improving FOSS tools, we wanted to provide an easy way to do so. Enter <b>CloudCron (Beta)</b>, which can run any Docker container at a specified schedule. Here's all you need to do:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sign up using your email address. We use a magic-link for both registration and login, so there are no passwords to remember or rotate.</li>

      <li>Tell us the name of the Docker image, the name of the command, and the arguments. As an example:

      <ul>
        <li>Docker image name: <code>femtopixel/google-lighthouse</code></li>

        <li>Command name: <code>lighthouse</code></li>

        <li>Arguments: <code>https://yourwebsite.com --output=html --output-path=stdout --quiet --no-enable-error-reporting</code></li>
      </ul>
  
      </li>

      <li>Tell us the job frequency using the crontab syntax: <code>0 9 * * *</code></li>

      <li>Specify the maximum number of times the job should be run. This puts an upper-bound on the cost.</li>

      <li>And finally, specify the endpoint where you'd like to receive the results of each execution. The endpoint can be either an email or webhook.</li>

      <li>We also have advanced options to configure the MIME/type and/or attachments, RAM size constraints etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This infrastructure is built on top of Google Cloud Components such as Cloud Scheduler, Cloud pub/sub, Cloud Functions, GKE, and CloudSQL to ensure reliability and scalability.</p>

    <p>ANY command that's available as an image on Docker Hub, can be run. Bring your own ideas!</p>

    <p>We're very excited to make <b>CloudCron (Beta)</b> publicly available today and as an introductory offer, <b>we're offering free executions of up to 3 jobs for a total cost of $5 each</b>. For any questions, please write to <a href="mailto:team@polyglot.network">team@polyglot.network</a>.</p>

    <p>If you run into bugs or missing features in any open-source tools, consider availing polyglot.network's services. By combining effort across multiple customers, we can do FOSS development at a fraction of the cost of doing the same in-house. Open-source software is suffering a tragedy of the commons, but it can be solved using network effects. You can <a href="/about" target="_blank">learn more about polyglot.network</a> here.</p>
