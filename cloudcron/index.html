    <h1>CloudCron - Painless Cron Jobs in the Cloud</h1>
    <p>
      At <a href="/">polyglot.network</a>, we work on a lot of open-source tools and add features/bugfixes that our customers demand. There are some really nifty command-line tools out there which our customers want to run on a periodic basis. Here are some examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#cli" target="_blank">LightHouse</a> by Google can generate a detailed performance report of any webpage. This is the same tool that Chrome's has built-in as "Performance" tab of its Dev Console. Usage: <code>lighthouse https://yoursite.example.com/</code></li>

      <li><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html" target="_blank">Apache Benchmark</a> can load-test your webapp by firing concurrent requests. Usage: <code>usage</code></li>

      <li><code>curl</code>, when run periodically, can act as a health-check.</li>  
    </ul>

    <p>In almost all of these cases, users want to receive the output of these commands to their email address or to a webhook endpoint, where this could be consumed programmatically. However, setting these up as periodic tasks is too cumbersome for many.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You need to provision a server</li>
      <li>Need to figure out a strategy for maintaining and rotating credentials</li>
      <li>Install all the dependencies (such as an OS, libraries) and keep them up-to-date</li>
      <li>Write custom code to send the output to an endpoint such as email or webhook</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All this is not hard for developers, but it IS cumbersome and annoying. It should be dead-easy to run batch jobs in the cloud. Since polyglot.network is all about improving FOSS tools, we wanted to provide an easy way to do so. Enter CloudCron, which is built on top of Google's Kubernetes Engine and can run arbitrary docker containers at a specified frequency. Here's all you need to do:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sign up using your email address. We use a magic-link for both registration and login, so there are no passwords to remember or rotate.</li>

      <li>Tell us the name of the docker image, the name of the command, and the arguments. As an example:

      <ul>
        <li>Docker image name: <code>google/lighthouse</code></li>

        <li>Command name: <code>lighthouse</code></li>

        <li>Arguments: <code>https://yourwebsite.example.com/</code></li>
      </ul>
  
      </li>

      <li>Tell us the job frequency using the crontab syntax: <code></code></li>

      <li>Specify the maximum number of times the job should be run. This puts an upper-bound on the cost.</li>

      <li>And finally, fill in the endpoint where you'd like to receive the results of each execution. The endpoint can be either an email or webhook.</li>

      <li>We have advanced options to configure the MIME/type and/or attachments etc.</li>

      <li>The cost depends on CPU and memory limits that you configure for your job.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This infrastructure is built on top of Google Cloud Components such as Cloud Scheduler, Cloud pub/sub, Cloud Functions, GKE, and CloudSQL to ensure reliability and scalability.</p>

    <p>Our customers have been using this for <code>lighthouse</code>, <code>ab</code>, and <code>curl</code> but since we support arbitrary docker images, ANY tool that's available as an image on Docker Hub can be run. Bring your own ideas!</p>

    <p>We're very excited to make CloudCron publicly available today and as an introductory offer, we're offering free executions of up to 3 jobs for a total cost of $5 each. For any questions, please write to team@polyglot.network</p>

    <p>If you run into bugs or missing features in any open-source tools, consider availing polyglot.network's services. By combining effort across multiple customers, we can do FOSS development at a fraction (as of now abour 1/3rd but will reduce drastically as we scale) of the cost of doing the same in-house. Open-source software is suffering a tragedy of the commons, but it can be solved using network effects.</p>
